# Planets Facts

This repository showcases my solution to the [Planets facts challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f). Frontend Mentor challenges have been instrumental in honing my coding skills by providing real-world projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology".
